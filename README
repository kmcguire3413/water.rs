_This library is missing support for remote nets! However, I will talk about
it like it has that support so you understand what to expect from it._

Water is a library that provides a network like communication structure. It allows
you to create just a local net for communication and join your local net if you
desire to another remote net either on the same machine or a remote machine across
a network.

The endpoint is the a reciever and sender of messages and resides on a specific net.
Each net has an ID and each endpoint has an ID. This means you can address:

    * specific endpoint on specific network
    * specific endpoint on all networks
    * any endpoint on a specific network
    * any endpoint on any network

Hopefully, in the future I can implement routing which will allow nets to be connected
into a graph and messages can be routed between the nets by special endpoints.
