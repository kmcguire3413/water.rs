//! Provides synchronous and asynchronous messages passing intra-process, and inter-process using
//! bridges. The messages can be of raw, clone, or sync type. Envisioned as a replacement for
//! channels. The raw messages can be sent to multiple endpoints and cross remote bridges. The sync
//! type hold a type instance and can only be sent intra-process and only one endpoint can recieve
//! the message. The clone messages are intra-process only but many endpoints can recieve.
//!
//! To see example usage checkout:
//!      https://github.com/kmcguire3413/water.rs/tree/master/tests
//!
//! In the tests directory you will find various test not only testing the functionality but
//! also demonstrating it. Also you can use this documentation as a reference.
//!
//! _Also scattered throughout this document are some examples._
//!
//! _This library is still in a developmental state (alpha) and is subject to large breaking changes._
//! Once all the design issues are worked out it will stabilize and become beta or release. Consider
//! all API to be experimental and unstable.
//!
//! Also be sure to check out the README which is visible at https://github.com/kmcguire3413/water.rs - 
//! it will detail more information about the library.
