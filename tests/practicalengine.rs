/*
    This tests and demonstrates:
        * segmented networks
        * selecting on multiple endpoints
        * splitting work onto multiple
            * dynamically
            * using sync messages

    We accept a `Request` packet which is accepted by one manager. We can have one or more
    managers and do not need to implement logic to select between them. The first avalible
    one will receive the message and only one. It will then produce work depending on the
    number of threads. If a thread becomes stuck it will cause the request/job to become
    stuck but some redundancy is provided using sync messages in that the other threads could
    continue to function. As each thread/worker finishes the result is sent back to the
    manager who has been tracking the jobs. When all results arrived a final packet is completed
    and this is sent to the requestor.

    The important parts are the potential scalability and the simplicity of implementation. We
    did not have to implement logic to handle multiple channels, ensure only one worker or manager
    received a packet, or serialize any of our data.
